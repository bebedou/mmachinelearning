Apply and learn data exploration and Machine Learning through Mixed Martial Arts

The purpose of this project is to apply basic Machine learning and data exploration concepts (while learning them) to Mixed martial Arts.
Using machine learning I attempted to classify MMA fighters using their record (Ko, Submission, Decision wins & losses) 
and a Neural network. I identified 4 MMA styles : 
0) MMArtist (complete fighter, able to win with striking, wrestling or grapling) 
1) Striker (Fighter who wins primarily with striking i.e Boxing, Kickboxing or Thai Boxing)
2) Wrestler (Fighter who wins by controlling the fight, taking it to the floor and beating pepole there)
3) Grappler (Fighter who wins by submitting people using submission wrestling or Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu)

I extracted data from Wikipedia to create a database of all MMA fighters with a record and stored it in a .csv file

I constructed a training dataset based on examples I hand-picked from the database and classified myself.

I added an histogram display of the amount of fighter in each category.
